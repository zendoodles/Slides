						<p>If you are curious about how people be come mentors,

					<h1>Advance Planning</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Talk about global sprint weekend.</p>p>
						<ul>
							<li>announce opportunities to participate, tweets, gratuitous irc factoid use</li>
							<li>repeat announcements</li>
							<li>hold local events, repeatedly</li>
							<li>blog about the benefits</li>
							<li>get other high profile people to recommend and remind about opportunities to participate in mentoring, slides for
								presenters at events, talking to active contributors about the benefits of sending people to mentoring</li>
						</ul>
							<h3>Needs</h3>
						<p>1 mentor for every 4 expected participants (explain what we used to think and why we think this now, eg people (mentors and participants) come and go throughout the day), and new mentors cannot handle as much as experienced mentors</p>

					<h1>Do Your Homework</h1>
					<h3>Tools and Techniques</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<h3>issue queue</h3>
						<p>Review tasks in advance so you’re familiar with some.</p>

						<h3>novice tag</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>on issues with novice tasks. (issues are hardly ever entirely novice)</li>
							<li>dreditor</li>
							<li>insert novice tasks button (adds links to contributor task documents for you)</li>
							<li>to update the issue summary remaining tasks section</li>
							<li>add tags for needs things identified in the remaining tasks, like needs screenshots needs tests
							not each remaining task is novice</li>
							<li>what are good novice tasks https://drupal.org/core-mentoring/novice-tasks</li>
							<li>when adding or removing the novice tag on tasks in the summary, or on the issue in general it can help to link to the novice-tasks documentation page so that the general community can discover the guidelines for what is a novice task</li>

							<li>for the number of people you expect at the sprint, identify about ⅓ that many issues with novice tasks
							not everyone will work on a separate issue, multiple people should work together… more on that in the section about matching people with tasks</li>

					<h1>Mentoring</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
						<li>make sure people feel welcome</li>
						<li>match tasks to participants, ensure they are successful the first time</li>
						have people work together on issues. (Sprints)
						10 people working on 10 different issues is not very effective. much of the work will stay unreviewed for a long time.
						have 10 people work on 3 issues, in groups, getting the issue moving much closer to rtbc.
						<li>keep people engaged even when they struggle</li>
						<li>help without being overbearing</li>
						<li>enable folks to continue afterward on their own</li>
						<li>say hi in irc</li>
						show task types (contributor tasks/task cards)
						when mentors are asked questions, say dont know
						show in public how to find the answer
						introduce people who do know the answer
						get them to hit save
						post half working work
						get feedback from others (save on the issue, paste link into irc, people are all over the world not just in the room)
						how to give constructive feedback
						review (core gates aka doesn't need to be perfect)
						</ul>
						have groups show an experienced mentor what they have been working on after a few hours. (So they can get their sticker!)
						if experienced mentor identifies a small change needed, have someone in the group mentor someone in the room who is not working on anything.
						bring the whole (bigger) group back up when they are done to get another look from the experienced mentor.

				Buddies/Mentors in organizations.
				Objectives buddy is culture/assimilation. Buddy is a long-term relationship. Where is the coffee? Who do I ask xyz?
				Mentor or team is more like mentored sprints. Group meetings? Office hours? Team code review

				Remove barriers to progress

				How do you protect your all-stars from being inundated with mentee questions?
				Office hours
				Get mentees to help each other

				How do you deal with a toxic contributor? Publicly
